<p>Emma’s Emporium began in 2006, inspired by direct experiences of Indian culture and generosity. Founded and run by Emma Chance; with a BA Hons in fine art, a love of clothing and textiles, and a passion for travelling, the adventure began.</p> 
<p>We buy direct from the makers at a price set by them ensuring a fair wage for all involved, we don&rsquo;t bulk buy or request bulk discounts and we keep overheads to a minimum to keep the price low for the consumer and high for the producer. Our silks range is made from recycled sari fabric, and any scraps are used to make bags and headbands, and packaging is kept to a minimum. 2017 see&rsquo;s the launch of our first Organic Cotton range of trousers, dyed with Azo Free dyes. We source our Organic Cotton from an accredited supplier of Organic Cotton based in Jaipur, Rajasthan (India). Emma&rsquo;s Emporium UK office is based in Somerset, we use recycled products wherever we can – from ink cartridges to paper to post bags; we reuse or recycle almost everything.</p>
<p>Our clothing is made for us by Jitesh, Lalit, and Kamlesh Rankawat and family, based on the outskirts of Pushkar (the Holy City of Rajasthan), in North West India. Famous for its sacred lake and annual camel fair, the small town is surrounded by the desert and is a melting pot of Indian and western spiritual tourists, hippies, backpackers, tailors and monkeys. The Rankawat&rsquo;s have a small factory on the upper floor of their family home where they employ a small number of skilled tailors from the surrounding area. We have worked with the family since we started trading in 2006, each year increasing the amount we buy and making regular small orders throughout the year to provide a sustainable income. This allows our business&rsquo; to grow together organically, benefiting them and their local community. We work together to choose fabrics and develop our designs, to produce avaried and unique collection combining the latest festival fashions with classic ethnic pieces.</p>
<p>We also stock goods from a number of small scale suppliers and producers in Rajasthan and Delhi, including Radhika Handicrafts&rsquo; range of beautiful home furnishings and textiles, Ravi Bindis in Delhi, Hand made recycled notebooks, Mr Things on Strings, and many more &mdash; mixing regular suppliers with one off purchases to keep our accessories range varied and up to date.</p>
