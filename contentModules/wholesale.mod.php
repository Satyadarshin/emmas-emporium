<p>Emma’s Emporium has been supplying clothing shops in the UK for the past five years, bringing them up to date ethnic and alternative clothing and accessories at competitive prices. We don’t attend trade fairs but we do regular road trips &mdash; we like to visit shops in person, often with a van full of goods, alongside shipping orders (with an average turn around of three days). A wholesale price list and paper catalogue is available on request. For enquiries or to make an appointment please contact us at emma@emmasemporium.org</p>
